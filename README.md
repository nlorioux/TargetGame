# TargetGame
To get used to Unity and to apply notions seen in class, I have coded a little game. I have looked on the internet to understand how to create what I had in mind. 
The goal is to shoot the targets to get the highest possible score within a minute. The score of each player is stored in a file to create a leaderboard at the end.
